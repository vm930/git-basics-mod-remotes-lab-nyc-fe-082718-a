# Git Remotes + GitHub Lab

## Objectives
1. Apply your GitHub command line skills
2. Create a remote repository on GitHub and connect it with a local folder

## Testing your Work

It's time to test our GitHub repository creation skills! Before you dive into
the instructions, in your terminal, run `learn` from the main lesson folder.
You should see a series of messages appear; these are the tests that must be
passed. As you follow the instructions below, continue to run `learn` in your
terminal to see your progress. As you complete the steps, you should see that
more and more of the tests pass, until all tests have been completed.

Here's a reminder the workflow for completing the lab:

1. Run `learn`.
2. Read the tests and errors.
3. Write code; repeat steps 1 and 2 often until a test passes.
4. Repeat as needed for further tests.
5. Run `learn submit` when finished!


**Note:** You must be in the parent folder of this lesson to run the tests, so
if, you navigate into a new folder, make sure to use `cd ..` until you're back
in the `git-remote-code-along` folder before running `learn`. 

## Instructions

As with most labs you'll encounter during this course, details will be minimal
on how to complete the deliverables. Make sure to use the tests to check your
progress, and read the messages, as they will provide clues regarding how to
pass them.

1. Create a new folder locally called 'my-repository', `cd` into the new
folder
2. Use the terminal to initialize a new git repository
3. Create a README.md file inside your new folder
3. Create a remote repository on [GitHub][github], using your GitHub account
4. Set the newly created GitHub repository as the remote repo for your new local
repository
5. Use the terminal to add your README.md so it is tracked by git, and commit
(don't forget to add `-m` when committing to include a message!)

**Note:** If you forget to include `-m` on when committing, you'll find you've
opened _vi_, the built in terminal text editor. To escape out of this editor,
press the 'esc' key once, then type `:x!` to close the editor and return to the
normal terminal.

6. Push up your local work to the remote

If you've passed all of the tests, run `learn submit` to register
completion of this lab in learn. As you become more comfortable with the
terminal and git, you'll find yourself using the workflow of initializing,
adding, committing and pushing your work on a regular basis.  

**Remember: Commit, and commit often!**
